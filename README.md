# Cadency

AI-powered chord assistant for music producers. Paste a YouTube link to analyze a track's harmonic style, then generate and edit chord progressions — complete with piano roll visualization, MIDI export, and sound playback.

> **Run locally only.** Cadency downloads actual audio via yt-dlp to detect key, tempo, and energy from the real waveform. Cloud servers (Railway, Render, etc.) get blocked by YouTube's bot detection — this is intentional, not a bug.

---

## What it does

### Track Analysis
Paste any YouTube URL → Cadency downloads the audio, analyzes it with librosa, and extracts:
- Key and scale (e.g. F minor, Aeolian)
- Tempo (BPM)
- Mood and energy level

Results are **cached in SQLite** — analyzing the same video twice returns instantly.

### "What fits next?"
Enter the chords you have so far. Cadency suggests 3 possible next chords — each with a plain English reason and a music theory label.

```
You have:  Am → F → C → ?

Cadency:   G   — perfect authentic cadence, resolves back to Am       (VII → i)
           Em  — stays minor, more introspective feel                  (v → i)
           Dm  — builds gentle tension before resolving                (iv → i)
```

### Style-matched progression generation
Generates a full chord progression matching the key, mood, and tempo extracted from a track (or entered manually). Each generation is **automatically saved** to your session history.

### Piano roll editor
Every generated progression is shown in an FL Studio-style piano roll. You can:
- **Drag individual notes** up/down to customize a chord's voicing independently of the other notes
- **Transpose entire chords** with the ↑/↓ buttons above each bar
- Bars with custom note edits are marked with a **✦** indicator

### Sound selector
Choose the synth tone used for playback:

| Preset | Oscillator | Character |
|---|---|---|
| Piano | Triangle | Natural, warm decay |
| Warm | Sine | Smooth, long release |
| Bright | Sawtooth | Punchy, edgy |
| Organ | Square | Sustained, electronic |

### Playback controls
- **Play all** — plays through the progression bar by bar
- **Loop** — repeats continuously until stopped
- **BPM slider** — 40–200 BPM, adjustable live during playback

### MIDI export
Exports the current (edited) progression as a `.mid` file using binary MIDI encoding — no external library.

### Progression history
Every generated progression is saved to a **per-session SQLite database** (cookie-based, no login required). From the history panel you can:
- **Load** any saved progression back into the editor
- **Rename** progressions with an inline pencil editor
- **Delete** entries

## Database

Three tables managed with SQLAlchemy 2.0 async + Alembic:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sessions` | Anonymous browser sessions (UUID cookie) |
| `analyses` | Cached YouTube analysis results, keyed by video ID |
| `progressions` | Saved chord progressions per session |

SQLite runs in **WAL mode** for better concurrent read performance. No login required — sessions are created automatically on first request.

To create or apply migrations:
```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — Python package manager
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) — required by librosa (`brew install ffmpeg` on Mac)
- Node.js 20+
- Gemini API key — get one free at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### Setup

```bash
brew install ffmpeg  # required for YouTube audio extraction

cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# add your GEMINI_API_KEY to backend/.env

make install
```

### Run (both servers at once)

```bash
make dev
```

Backend at `http://localhost:8000` (docs at `/docs`) — Frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop both.

### Make targets

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `make dev` | Start backend + frontend together |
| `make dev-backend` | Backend only |
| `make dev-frontend` | Frontend only |
| `make kill` | Kill anything running on ports 8000 and 3000 |
| `make test` | Run all tests |
| `make test-backend` | pytest (backend) |
| `make test-frontend` | lint (frontend) |
| `make install` | Install all dependencies |

---

## Environment Variables

**Backend** (`.env`):
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key   # used only for mood detection
```

**Frontend** (`.env.local`, optional):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

> No YouTube API key needed. Audio is downloaded directly via yt-dlp.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Spotify support (audio features API — no download needed)
- [ ] SoundCloud support (yt-dlp already supports it)
- [ ] Per-session progression sharing via short URL
